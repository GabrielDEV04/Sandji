Hey me it's Gabriel better known under the pseudonym of Sandji. I develop on Fivem, Minecraft and I touch a bit the Web.

I'm still an apprentice in my development tasks. 

My Projects :

SLife Roleplay : A French GTA V Roleplay Server on Fivem based on the US, I'm developing my server since almost one month.
My goal : Originality !
